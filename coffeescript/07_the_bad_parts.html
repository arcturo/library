<h1>The Bad Parts</h1>

<p>JavaScript is a tricky beast, and knowing the parts that you should avoid is just as important as knowing about the parts you should use. As Sun Tzu says, "know your enemy", and that's exactly what we're going to do in the chapter, exploring the dark side of JavaScript and revealing all the lurking monsters ready to pounce on the unsuspecting developer.</p>

<p>As I mentioned in the introduction, CoffeeScript's awesomeness lies not only in it's syntax, but in it's ability to fix some of JavaScript's warts. However, due to the fact that CoffeeScript statements have a direct translation into JavaScript, and don't run in a virtual machine or interpreter, the language is not a silver bullet to all of JavaScript's bugbears and there's still some issues you need to be aware about.</p>

<p>First, let's talk about what things the language does solve.</p>

<h2>A JavaScript Subset</h2>

<p>CoffeeScript's syntax only covers a subset of JavaScript's, the famous <em>Good Parts</em>, so already there's less to fix. Let's take the <code>with</code> statement for example. This statement has for a long time been "considered harmful", and should be avoided. <code>with</code> was intended to provide a shorthand for writing recurring property lookups on objects. For example, instead of writing:</p>

<pre><code>dataObj.users.alex.email = "info@eribium.org";
</code></pre>

<p>You could write:</p>

<pre><code>with(dataObj.users.alex) {
  email = "info@eribium.org";
}
</code></pre>

<p>Setting aside the fact that we shouldn't have such a deep object in the first place, the syntax is quite clean. Except for one thing. It's damn confusing to the JavaScript interpreter - it doesn't know exactly what you're going to do in the <code>with</code> context, and forces the specified object to be searched first for all name lookups.</p>

<p>This really hurts performance and means the interpreter has to turn off all sorts of JIT optimizations. Additionally <code>with</code> statements can't be minified using tools like <a href="https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS">uglify-js</a>. They're also deprecated and removed from future JavaScript versions. All things considered, it's much better just to avoid using them, and CoffeeScript takes this a step further by eliminating them from it's syntax. In other words, using <code>with</code> in CoffeeScript will throw a syntax error.</p>

<h2>Global variables</h2>

<p>By default, your JavaScript programs run in a global scope, and by default any variables created are in that global scope. If you want to create a variable in the local scope, JavaScript requires explicitly indicating that fact using the <code>var</code> keyword.</p>

<pre><code>usersCount = 1;        // Global
var groupsCount = 2;   // Global

(function(){              
  pagesCount = 3;      // Global
  var postsCount = 4;  // Local
})()
</code></pre>

<p>This is a bit of an odd decision since the vast majority of the time you'll be creating local variables not global, so why not make that the default? As it stands, developers have to remember to put <code>var</code> statements before any variables they're initializing, or face weird bugs when variables accidentally conflict and overwrite each other.</p>

<p>Luckily CoffeeScript comes to your rescue here by eliminating implicit global variable assignment entirely. In other words, the <code>var</code> keyword is reserved in CoffeeScript, and will trigger a syntax error if used. Local variables are created implicitly by default, and it's very difficult to create global variables without explicitly assigning them as properties on <code>window</code>.</p>

<p>Let's have a look at an example of CoffeeScript's variable assignment:</p>

<p><span class="csscript"></span></p>

<pre><code>outerScope = true
do -&gt;
  innerScope = true
</code></pre>

<p>Compiles down to:</p>

<pre><code>var outerScope;
outerScope = true;
(function() {
  var innerScope;
  return innerScope = true;
})();
</code></pre>

<p>Notice how CoffeeScript initializes variables (using <code>var</code>) automatically in the context they're first used. Whilst it's impossible to shadow outer variables, you can still refer to and access them. You need to watch out for this, be careful that you're not reusing the name of an external variable accidentally if you're writing a deeply nested function or class. For example, here we're accidentally overwriting the <code>package</code> variable in a Class function:</p>

<p><span class="csscript"></span></p>

<pre><code>package = require('./package')

class Hem
  build: -&gt;
    # Overwrites outer variable!
    package = @hemPackage.compile()

  hemPackage: -&gt;
    package.create()
</code></pre>

<p>Global variables are needed from time to time, and to create those you need to set them as properties on <code>window</code>:</p>

<p><span class="csscript"></span></p>

<pre><code>  class window.Asset
    constructor: -&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>By ensuring global variables are explicit, rather than implicit, CoffeeScript removes one of the major sources of bugs in JavaScript programs.</p>

<h2>Semicolons</h2>

<p>JavaScript does not enforce the use of semicolons in source code, so it's possible to omit them. However, behind the scenes the JavaScript compiler still needs them, so the parser automatically inserts them whenever it encounters a parse error due to a missing semicolon. In other words, it'll try to evaluate a statement without semicolons and, if that fails, tries again using semicolons.</p>

<p>Unfortunately this is a tremendously bad idea, and can actually change the behavior of your code. Take the following example: looks like valid JavaScript, right?</p>

<pre><code>function() {}
(window.options || {}).property
</code></pre>

<p>Wrong, well at least according to the parser; it raises a syntax error. In case of a leading parenthesis, the parser will not insert a semicolon. The code gets transformed onto one line:</p>

<pre><code>function() {}(window.options || {}).property
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can see the issue, and why the parser is complaining. When you're writing JavaScript, you should always include semicolons after statements. Fortunately CoffeeScript gets round all this hassle by not having semicolons in its syntax. Rather the semicolons are inserted automatically (at the right places) when the CoffeeScript is compiled down to JavaScript.</p>

<h2>Reserved words</h2>

<p>Certain keywords in JavaScript are reserved for future versions of JavaScript, such as <code>const</code>, <code>enum</code> and <code>class</code>. Using these as variable names in your JavaScript programs can produce unpredictable results; some browsers will cope with them just fine, and others will choke. CoffeeScript neatly sidesteps this issue, by detecting if you're using a reserved keyword, and escaping it if necessary.</p>

<p>For example, let's say you were to use the reserved keyword <code>class</code> as a property on an object, your CoffeeScript might look like this:</p>

<p><span class="csscript"></span></p>

<pre><code>myObj = {
  delete: "I am a keyword!"
}
myObj.class = -&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The CoffeeScript parser notices you're using a reserved keyword, and quotes it for you:</p>

<pre><code>var myObj;
myObj = {
  "delete": "I am a keyword!"
};
myObj["class"] = function() {};
</code></pre>

<h2>Equality comparisons</h2>

<p>The weak equality comparison in JavaScript has some confusing behavior and is often the source of confusing bugs. The example below is taken from <a href="http://bonsaiden.github.com/JavaScript-Garden/#types.equality">JavaScript Garden's equality section</a> which delves into the issue in some depth.</p>

<p><span class="csscript"></span></p>

<pre><code>""           ==   "0"           // false
0            ==   ""            // true
0            ==   "0"           // true
false        ==   "false"       // false
false        ==   "0"           // true
false        ==   undefined     // false
false        ==   null          // false
null         ==   undefined     // true
" \t\r\n"    ==   0             // true
</code></pre>

<p>The reason behind this behavior is that the weak equality coerces types automatically. I'm sure you'll agree this is all pretty ambiguous, and can lead to unexpected results and bugs.</p>

<p>The solution is to instead use the strict equality operator, which consists of three equal signs: <code>===</code>. It works exactly like the normal equality operator, but without any type coercion. It's recommended to always use the strict equality operator, and explicitly convert types if needs be.</p>

<p>CoffeeScript solves this by simply replacing all weak comparisons with strict ones, in other words converting all <code>==</code> comparators into <code>===</code>. You can't do a a weak equality comparison in CoffeeScript, and you should explicitly convert types before comparing them if necessary.</p>

<p>This doesn't mean you can ignore type coercion in CoffeeScript completely though, especially when it comes to checking the 'truthfulness' of variables during flow control. Blank strings, <code>null</code>, <code>undefined</code> and the number <code>0</code> are all coerced to <code>false</code></p>

<p><span class="csscript"></span></p>

<pre><code>alert("Empty Array")  unless [].length
alert("Empty String") unless ""
alert("Number 0")     unless 0
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to explicitly check for <code>null</code> and <code>undefined</code>, then you can use CoffeeScript's existential operator:</p>

<p><span class="csscript"></span></p>

<pre><code>alert("This is not called") unless ""?
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>alert()</code> in the previous example won't be called, as the empty string isn't equal to <code>null</code>.</p>

<h2>Function definition</h2>

<p>Oddly enough in JavaScript, functions can be defined after they're used. For example, the following runs absolutely fine, even though <code>wem</code> is defined after it's called:</p>

<pre><code>wem();
function wem() {}
</code></pre>

<p>The is because of function scope. Functions get hoisted before the programs execution and as such are available everywhere in the scope they were defined in, even if called before the actual definition in the source. The trouble is, hoisting behavior differs between browser; for example:</p>

<pre><code>if (true) {
  function declaration() {
    return "first";
  }
} else {
  function declaration() {
    return "second";
  }
}
declaration();
</code></pre>

<p>In some browsers such as Firefox, <code>declaration()</code> will return <code>"first"</code>, and in other browsers like Chrome it'll return <code>"second"</code>, even though it looks like the <code>else</code> statement is never run.</p>

<p>If you want to know more about declarative functions, then you should read <a href="http://kangax.github.com/nfe/">Juriy Zaytsev's guide</a>, where he delves into the specifics. Suffice to say, they have fairly ambiguous behavior, and can lead to problems later down the road. All things considered, it's best to steer clear of them by using function expressions instead:</p>

<pre><code>var wem = function(){};
wem();
</code></pre>

<p>CoffeeScript's approach to this is to remove declarative functions entirely, using only function expressions.</p>

<h2>Number property lookups</h2>

<p>A flaw in JavaScript's parser means that the <em>dot notation</em> on numbers is interpreted as a floating point literal, rather than a property lookup. For example, the following JavaScript will cause a syntax error:</p>

<pre><code>5.toString();
</code></pre>

<p>JavaScript's parser is looking for another Number after the dot, and so raises an <code>Unexpected token</code> error when it encounters <code>toString()</code>. The solution to this is to either use parenthesis, or add an additional dot.</p>

<pre><code>(5).toString();
5..toString();
</code></pre>

<p>Fortunately CoffeeScript's parsers is clever enough to deal with this issue by using double dot notations automatically (as in the example above) whenever you access properties on Numbers.</p>

<h1>The un-fixed parts</h1>

<p>Whilst CoffeeScript goes some length to solving some of JavaScript's design flaws, it can only go so far. As I mentioned previously, CoffeeScript's strictly limited to static analysis by design, and doesn't do any runtime checking for performance reasons. CoffeeScript uses a straight source-to-source compiler, the idea being that every CoffeeScript statement results in a equivalent JavaScript statement. CoffeeScript doesn't provide an abstraction over any of JavaScript's keywords, such as <code>typeof</code>, and as such some design flaws in JavaScript's design also apply to CoffeeScript.</p>

<p>In the previous sections we covered some design flaws in JavaScript that CoffeeScript fixes. Now let's talk about some of JavaScript's flaws that CoffeeScript can't fix.</p>

<h2>Using eval</h2>

<p>Whilst CoffeeScript removes some of JavaScript's foibles, other features are a necessary evil, you just need to be aware of their shortcomings. A case in point, is the <code>eval()</code> function. Whilst undoubtedly it has its uses, you should know about its drawbacks, and avoid it if possible. The <code>eval()</code> function will execute a string of JavaScript code in the local scope, and functions like <code>setTimeout()</code> and <code>setInterval()</code> can also both take a string as their first argument to be evaluated.</p>

<p>However, like <code>with</code>, <code>eval()</code> throws the compiler off track, and is a major performance hog. As the compiler has no idea what's inside until runtime, it can't perform any optimizations like inlining. Another concern is with security. If you give it dirty input, <code>eval</code> can easily open up your code for injection attacks. 99% of the time when you're using <code>eval</code>, there are better &amp; safer alternatives (such as square brackets).</p>

<p><span class="csscript"></span></p>

<pre><code># Don't do this
model = eval(modelName)

# Use square brackets instead
model = window[modelName]
</code></pre>

<h2>Using typeof</h2>

<p>The <code>typeof</code> operator is probably the biggest design flaw of JavaScript, simply because it's basically completely broken. In fact, it really has only one use, checking to see if a value is <code>undefined</code>.</p>

<p><span class="csscript"></span></p>

<pre><code>typeof undefinedVar is "undefined"
</code></pre>

<p>For all other types of type checking, <code>typeof</code> fails rather miserably, returning inconsistent results depending on the browser and how instances were instantiated. This isn't something that CoffeeScript can help you with either, since the language uses static analysis and has no runtime type checking. You're on your own here.</p>

<p>To illustrate the problem, here's a table taken from <a href="http://bonsaiden.github.com/JavaScript-Garden/">JavaScript Garden</a> which shows some of the major inconsistencies in the keyword's type checking.</p>

<pre><code>Value               Class      Type
-------------------------------------
"foo"               String     string
new String("foo")   String     object
1.2                 Number     number
new Number(1.2)     Number     object
true                Boolean    boolean
new Boolean(true)   Boolean    object
new Date()          Date       object
new Error()         Error      object
[1,2,3]             Array      object
new Array(1, 2, 3)  Array      object
new Function("")    Function   function
/abc/g              RegExp     object
new RegExp("meow")  RegExp     object
{}                  Object     object
new Object()        Object     object
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, depending on if you define a string with quotes or with the <code>String</code> class affects the result of <code>typeof</code>. Logically <code>typeof</code> should return <code>"string"</code> for both checks, but for the latter it returns <code>"object"</code>. Unfortunately the inconstancies only get worse from there.</p>

<p>So what can we use for type checking in JavaScript? Well, luckily <code>Object.prototype.toString()</code> comes to the rescue here. If we invoke that function in the context of a particular object, it'll return the correct type. All we need to do is massage the string it returns, so we end up with the sort of string <code>typeof</code> should be returning. Here's an example implementation ported from jQuery's <code>$.type</code>:</p>

<p><span class="csscript"></span></p>

<pre><code>type = do -&gt;
  classToType = {}
  for name in "Boolean Number String Function Array Date RegExp Undefined Null".split(" ")
    classToType["[object " + name + "]"] = name.toLowerCase()

  (obj) -&gt;
    strType = Object::toString.call(obj)
    classToType[strType] or "object"

# Returns the sort of types we'd expect:
type("")         # "string"
type(new String) # "string"
type([])         # "array"
type(/\d/)       # "regexp"
type(new Date)   # "date"
type(true)       # "boolean"
type(null)       # "null"
type({})         # "object"
</code></pre>

<p>If you're checking to see if an variable has been defined, you'll still need to use <code>typeof</code> otherwise you'll get a <code>ReferenceError</code>.</p>

<p><span class="csscript"></span></p>

<pre><code>if typeof aVar isnt "undefined"
  objectType = type(aVar)
</code></pre>

<p>Or more succinctly with the existential operator:</p>

<pre><code>objectType = type(aVar?)
</code></pre>

<p>As an alternative to type checking, you can often use duck typing and the CoffeeScript existential operator together to eliminating the need to resolve an object's type. For example, let's say we're pushing a value onto an array. We could say that, as long as the 'array like' object implements <code>push()</code>, we should treat it like an array:</p>

<p><span class="csscript"></span></p>

<pre><code>anArray?.push? aValue
</code></pre>

<p>If <code>anArray</code> is an object other than an array than the existential operator will ensure that <code>push()</code> is never called.</p>

<h2>Using instanceof</h2>

<p>JavaScript's <code>instanceof</code> keyword is nearly as broken as <code>typeof</code>. Ideally <code>instanceof</code> would compare the constructor of two object, returning a boolean if one was an instance of the other. However, in reality <code>instanceof</code> only works when comparing custom made objects. When it comes to comparing built-in types, it's as useless as <code>typeof</code>.</p>

<p><span class="csscript"></span></p>

<pre><code>new String("foo") instanceof String # true
"foo" instanceof String             # false
</code></pre>

<p>Additionally, <code>instanceof</code> also doesn't work when comparing object from different frames in the browser. In fact, <code>instanceof</code> only returns a correct result for custom made objects, such as CoffeeScript classes.</p>

<p><span class="csscript"></span></p>

<pre><code>class Parent
class Child extends Parent

child = new Child
child instanceof Child  # true
child instanceof Parent # true
</code></pre>

<p>Make sure you only use it for your own objects or, even better, stick clear of it.</p>

<h2>Using delete</h2>

<p>The <code>delete</code> keyword can only safely be used for removing properties inside objects.</p>

<p><span class="csscript"></span></p>

<pre><code>anObject = {one: 1, two: 2}
delete anObject.one
anObject.hasOwnProperty("one") # false
</code></pre>

<p>Any other use, such as deleting variables or function's won't work.</p>

<p><span class="csscript"></span></p>

<pre><code>aVar = 1
delete aVar
typeof Var # "integer"
</code></pre>

<p>It's rather peculiar behavior, but there you have it. If you want to remove a reference to a variable, just assign it to <code>null</code> instead.</p>

<p><span class="csscript"></span></p>

<pre><code>aVar = 1
aVar = null
</code></pre>

<h2>Using parseInt</h2>

<p>JavaScript's <code>parseInt()</code> function can return unexpected results if you pass a string to it without informing it of the proper base. For example:</p>

<pre><code># Returns 8, not 10!
parseInt('010') is 8
</code></pre>

<p>Always pass a base to the function to make it work correctly:</p>

<pre><code># Use base 10 for the correct result
parseInt('010', 10) is 10
</code></pre>

<p>This isn't something CoffeeScript can do for you; you'll just have to remember to always specify a base when using <code>parseInt()</code>.</p>

<h2>Strict mode</h2>

<p>Strict mode is a new feature of ECMAScript 5 that allows you to run a JavaScript program or function in a <em>strict</em> context. This strict context throws more exceptions and warnings than the normal context, giving developers some indication when they're straying from best practices, writing un-optimizable code or making common mistakes. In other words, strict mode reduces bugs, increases security, improves performance and eliminates some difficult to use language features. What's not to like?</p>

<p>Strict mode is currently supported in the following browsers:</p>

<ul>
<li>Chrome >= 13.0</li>
<li>Safari >= 5.0</li>
<li>Opera >= 12.0</li>
<li>Firefox >= 4.0</li>
<li>IE >= 10.0</li>
</ul>


<p>Having said that, strict mode is completely backwards compatible with older browsers. Programs using it should run fine in either a strict or normal context.</p>

<h3>Strict mode changes</h3>

<p>Most of the changes strict mode introduces pertain to JavaScript's syntax:</p>

<ul>
<li>Errors on duplicate property and function argument names</li>
<li>Errors on incorrect use of the <code>delete</code> operator</li>
<li>Access to <code>arguments.caller</code> &amp; <code>arguments.callee</code> throws an error (for performance reasons)</li>
<li>Using the <code>with</code> operator will raise a syntax error</li>
<li>Certain variables such as <code>undefined</code> are no longer writeable</li>
<li>Introduces additional reserved keywords, such as <code>implements</code>, <code>interface</code>, <code>let</code>, <code>package</code>, <code>private</code>, <code>protected</code>, <code>public</code>, <code>static</code>, and <code>yield</code></li>
</ul>


<p>However, strict mode also changes some runtime behavior:</p>

<ul>
<li>Global variables are explicit (<code>var</code> always required). The global value of <code>this</code> is <code>undefined</code>.</li>
<li><code>eval</code> can't introduce new variables into the local context</li>
<li>Function statements have to be defined before they're used (previously functions could be <a href="http://whereswalden.com/2011/01/24/new-es5-strict-mode-requirement-function-statements-not-at-top-level-of-a-program-or-function-are-prohibited/">defined anywhere</a>).</li>
<li><code>arguments</code> is immutable</li>
</ul>


<p>CoffeeScript already abides by a lot of strict mode's requirements, such as always using <code>var</code> when defining variables, but it's still very useful to enable strict mode in your CoffeeScript programs. Indeed, CoffeeScript is taking this a step further and in <a href="https://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script/issues/1547">future versions</a> will check a program's compliance to strict mode at compile time.</p>

<h3>Strict mode usage</h3>

<p>All you need to do to enable strict checking is start your script or function with the following string:</p>

<p><span class="csscript"></span></p>

<pre><code>-&gt;
  "use strict"

  # ... your code ...
</code></pre>

<p>That's it, just the <code>'use strict'</code> string. Couldn't be simpler and it's completely backwards compatible. Let's take a look at strict mode in action. The following function will raise a syntax error in strict mode, but run fine in the usual mode:</p>

<p><span class="csscript"></span></p>

<pre><code>do -&gt;
  "use strict"
  console.log(arguments.callee)
</code></pre>

<p>Strict mode has removed access to <code>arguments.caller</code> &amp; <code>arguments.callee</code> as they're major performance hogs, and is now throwing syntax errors whenever they're used.</p>

<p>There's a particular gotcha you should look out for when using strict mode, namely creating global variables with <code>this</code>. The following example will throw a <code>TypeError</code> in strict mode, but run fine in a normal context, creating a global variable:</p>

<p><span class="csscript"></span></p>

<pre><code>do -&gt;
  "use strict"
  class @Spine
</code></pre>

<p>The reason behind this disparity is that in strict mode <code>this</code> is <code>undefined</code>, whereas normally it refers to the <code>window</code> object. The solution to this is to explicitly set global variables on the <code>window</code> object.</p>

<p><span class="csscript"></span></p>

<pre><code>do -&gt;
  "use strict"
  class window.Spine
</code></pre>

<p>Whilst I recommend enabling strict mode, but it's worth noting that script mode doesn't enable any new features that aren't ready possible in JavaScript, and will actually slow down your code a bit by having the VM do more checks at runtime. You may want to develop with strict mode, and deploy to production without it.</p>

<h2>JavaScript Lint</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.javascriptlint.com/">JavaScript Lint</a> is a JavaScript code quality tool, and running your programs through it is a great way of improving code quality and best practices. The project was based on a similar tool called <a href="http://www.jslint.com">JSLint</a>. Check out JSLint's site for a <a href="http://www.jslint.com/lint.html">great list</a> of issues that it checks for, including global variables, missing semicolons and weak equality comparisons.</p>

<p>The good news is that CoffeeScript already 'lints' all of its output, so CoffeeScript generated JavaScript is already JavaScript Lint compatible. In fact, the <code>coffee</code> tool has support for a <code>--lint</code> option:</p>

<pre><code>coffee --lint index.coffee
  index.coffee: 0 error(s), 0 warning(s)
</code></pre>
